# shuffle-fitness-ms4

This is a full-stack web application using Django framework alongside HTML, CSS, Python and JavaScript.

This application is for a fictional fitness and nutrition company called Shuffle Fitness. The application will allow users to select an fitness subsrciption that suits them, they will be able to set-up payment using stripe. The user will need to create an account to be able to access paid for material, the user will also be able to rate the material that they have purchased. Some other features that this site will use are confirmation emails, CRUD for the admin to create new content and control the database. 

This webpage is for educational purposes and the stripe functionality will only accept test card details.

* To use the stripe card payment please use the following card information:
    * Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
    * Any Date or you can use: 04/24
    * Any CVV Number

### Unforunately this is not complete and I have had to submit this site while not being 100% ready. I do apologise for the inconvience for this! I understand that this will be a fail and I will make sure that I work very hard to make it a pass on the potential resubmission date.

### **Design**
The design of this site will be simplistic, but with images that bring out some life onto the site. There will be little bits of colour, to break up the white and black text. 

The site needs to be a Mobile First design, so that it can work on mobiles, tablets and also laptops and desktop screens. The images, buttons and forms are all kept to a straight edge rather than rounded to give the site a stronger feel.

The navbar will collapse into a dropdown for the small screens, with search functionality.

Within the footer there will be social links and contact info, so that the user can further connect with the site owner. 

Toasts will pop up to give a success message or even a warning message.
